# Wedge-to-Conic physical convention

## Configurations

The source acquisition is a vertical-axis turntable with the article pitched
relative to the vertical pylon and a horizontal radar line of sight. With signed
mechanical turntable angle `phi` and body-y wedge pitch `tau`, the body-to-world
attitude is

```text
R_source = Rz(phi) Ry(tau).
```

The output represents look directions in body-relative conic longitude/elevation
coordinates with the spherical vertical/horizontal basis. Each output elevation
row describes a constant-elevation conic cut wherever the measurements provide
coverage.

For a fixed world line of sight along `+x`, the source look direction expressed
in body coordinates is

```text
r_body = (cos(tau) cos(phi), -sin(phi), sin(tau) cos(phi)).
```

Therefore

```text
longitude = atan2(r_y, r_x)
latitude  = asin(r_z).
```

This direction mapping was checked independently against the complete attitude
matrix `R_source.T @ (1,0,0)`.

Positive `phi` is a right-handed rotation about fixed world `+z`; positive `tau`
is a right-handed pitch about body `+y` before the turntable rotation. Input
azimuth must follow that mechanical-angle convention, rather than already being
body-relative conic longitude.

For each fixed `tau`, the direction traces a great circle on the body sphere.
Its elevation varies during the revolution, crossing waterline at the two side
aspects. At zero tilt, that great circle is the waterline conic cut itself.

## Waterline-only conversion

A dataset with a single tilt exactly equal to zero (including signed `-0`) uses
an exact azimuth relabel:

```text
conic azimuth   = wrap(-phi)
conic elevation = 0.
```

The output azimuths are sorted and samples are reordered with them. Magnitudes,
phases, and the available polarization channels are preserved; no interpolation
or polarization rotation is performed. Phase may be unknown and a single
polarization channel is sufficient. A full turntable revolution is still
required. A small nonzero tilt is not treated as zero.

The result records `wedge_to_conic_mode = waterline_relabel`. In the dataset
table, its name includes `waterline conic` and its history identifies the exact
relabel.

## Polarization transformation

For acquisitions with multiple measured tilts, conversion uses the following
coherent polarization transformation.

The range V/H basis in the source body frame is obtained by transforming fixed
world vertical and horizontal vectors:

```text
V_wedge = R_source.T (0,0,1)
H_wedge = R_source.T (0,1,0).
```

The output uses the standard conic spherical basis `(V_conic, H_conic)`. If
`C[i,a] = dot(wedge_basis[i], conic_basis[a])`, the monostatic Jones matrix is
transformed coherently as

```text
S_conic = C.T S_wedge C.
```

The implementation interpolates the complex source Jones matrix in measured
`(phi,tau)` coordinates, then applies this basis transformation at every output
query. It never interpolates dB values or wrapped phase.

## Data requirements and limitations

- A complete turntable revolution is required at every measured tilt.
- Except for the waterline-only case above, at least two measured wedge tilts
  must be present in one dataset. Join separate tilt datasets before converting;
  selecting multiple datasets converts each independently.
- A single nonzero fixed tilt traces a great circle, not a constant-elevation
  conic azimuth cut. It cannot determine a complete conic grid.
- For tilted data, meaningful finite phase is required for every finite sample.
  VV and HH plus at least one of VH/HV are required. For monostatic reciprocal
  data, one measured cross-pol supplies the other. Co-pol-only conversion is
  permitted only when the user explicitly assumes missing cross-pol is zero.
  These phase and polarization requirements do not apply to the exact
  waterline-only relabel.
- The wedge acquisition cannot cover every normal conic look. In particular,
  nonzero-elevation side aspects require wedge pitch approaching +/-90 degrees.
  Unsupported output cells remain `NaN`; there is no extrapolation.
  For a typical -20 to +20 degree pitch sweep, all measured great circles cross
  waterline at side aspect, so nonzero-elevation conic cuts have gaps near the
  sides even when every tilt was measured over a complete revolution.
- Selecting Wedge-to-Conic states the requested axis interpretation, and the
  converted dataset records that interpretation as an assumption. GRIM does
  not tag datasets with a coordinate system, so the user is responsible for
  applying it only to wedge/turntable acquisitions.

The independent release regressions are in `test_wedge_conversion.py` and use
an object-fixed complex dyadic oracle rather than replaying the production
formulas.
