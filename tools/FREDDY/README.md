# FREDDY

FREDDY evaluates one-dimensional, infinite-planar material stacks. It computes
TE/TM reflection, transmission, absorption, and front-face input impedance for
frequency-dependent dielectric/magnetic layers and zero-thickness resistive
sheets. Layers are ordered from the incident side to the backing.

FREDDY does **not** calculate finite-object radar cross section or dBsm. Its
metal-backed impedance export can be used as a planar equivalent boundary
condition by the companion GHOST RCS solvers when that physical approximation
is appropriate.

## File Converter

Choose **File → File Converter…** in FREDDY (standalone or embedded in GRIM).
Open or drop a CSV, TXT, DAT, ASC, ASCII, or TSV table. The preview supports
comma, tab, semicolon, and whitespace delimiters, optional headers, skipped
preamble lines, UTF-8/BOM and Windows-1252 text, and Fortran `D` exponents.
Blank lines and full-line `#`, `%`, `!`, and `//` comments are ignored.

Each output row lets you label a variable, choose its source column or a
constant for every row, and select its input/output units. Uncheck unwanted
columns. Frequency conversion supports Hz, kHz, MHz, GHz, and THz in both
directions; angles support degrees/radians, with length, time and impedance
units also available. **As written** preserves a column without conversion.
No frequency unit is inferred from the size of a number.

Use **Preview conversion**, then **Convert and save…** to write a new table.
Converted headers include units, such as `frequency_ghz`. All rows are checked
before the output is published; a failure leaves an existing output untouched.
The source cannot be used as the destination. For a FREDDY material file,
label columns `frequency`, `eps_real`, `eps_imag`, `mu_real`, `mu_imag`, choose
Hz output for frequency, and select comma output. Missing relative permeability
columns can be constants `1` and `0`. The resulting header is
`frequency_hz,eps_real,eps_imag,mu_real,mu_imag`.

## Launch

FREDDY is available as the **FREDDY** tab in the main GRIM window. From the
repository root, install the integrated application and run it with:

```text
py -3 -m pip install -e .
grim
```

The embedded tab and standalone window use the same authoritative code in
this directory. Inverse Design supports **Stop and keep best** and resume;
Material Mix supports stopping with incomplete results discarded.
**Sensitivity & Yield** supports stopping while retaining the previous completed study. Ordinary
analysis/export jobs run to completion. GRIM prevents closing while a job is running.

**User-defined constant layers:** choose **Add Layer → Material source →
Constant εr / μr (all frequencies)**. Enter the four relative-property components
(εr real/imaginary and μr real/imaginary) and thickness. For example, εr = 6 − 0.8j
and μr = 1 − 0.1j means inputs `6`, `-0.8`, `1`, `-0.1`. Negative imaginary values
represent passive loss. Values must be finite and the complex ε/μ magnitudes
must be nonsingular, using the same validation as material CSVs. These isotropic
values are applied directly at every frequency and saved in the project; no
temporary material CSV is created. Constant and measured layers can share a
stack. Impedance, Off Angle, Thickness, IBC Batch, inverse design, and coating
checks support both. Material Explorer continues to inspect measured CSVs.

**About & Guide** is the single home for application help, angle and polarization
conventions, material definitions, and result interpretation. Search its topic
list for a plot or task. Eight mode-specific workflows explain setup, the
expected response, how to make a decision, and the next step. Plot catalogs
cover sweep/IBC views, inverse candidates, blend targets, and Material Explorer.
**F1** opens the active mode's workflow; **Explain view** in sweep and inverse
Results opens its plot catalog. Workflow links open Setup while preserving
inputs and completed results. The guide fills the workspace without layer
controls or plots. File and View actions remain in the menu bar.

Analysis Results also offer **Export comparison CSV…** in the plot toolbar.
The report includes every sampled thickness/angle, reflection basis and bound,
target/band, passing bandwidth and coverage, worst reflection, passing margin,
full-sweep sampled null frequency, output path, and captured run/stack context.
The sortable **Margin (dB)** column is target minus worst reflection: a
nonnegative value passes the entire selected band. Span displays compare nominal
reflection. These reports are analysis records, not nominal IBC inputs. Figure
display reduction and table sorting do not change exported samples or row identity.

Dense Off Angle and Thickness sweeps retain NumPy grids and update tolerance
bounds in place instead of repeatedly boxing arrays into Python lists. Shared
material paths are read once per stack load and refreshed on each later run.
Unchanged comparison tables and nominal band metrics are reused during plot
changes. The public computation API still returns lists unless array output is
explicitly requested.

For a standalone window on Windows, double-click `Launch_FREDDY_GUI.bat` or
run the following from this directory:

```text
py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py -3 impedance_gui.py
```

`FREDDY_ROOT_PATH` is an optional GRIM development override that can point the
embedded tab at another FREDDY root. The Windows launcher first uses the
repository-root `.venv`, then an active `VIRTUAL_ENV`, then a system Python;
FREDDY does not require a separate environment under `tools/FREDDY`.

FREDDY output is CSV, not `.grim`: save a three-column IBC impedance file or a
five-column material file for GHOST. In integrated GRIM, **Export and attach to
current GHOST geometry** accepts only a nominal PEC-backed IBC or nominal
material export. GHOST must already have an active saved/loaded `.geo`; the
handoff validates and copies the file beside that geometry, then you press
**Save Geometry** to persist its reference. Off-angle, thickness, uncertainty,
and other analysis CSVs cannot be attached through this action. GRIM
deliberately does not load any FREDDY CSV into its RCS dataset table.

## Material Explorer

Use **Material Explorer** to compare any number of validated five-column
material CSVs without changing the FREDDY layer stack or running a solver. Add
files directly, drag them onto the explorer, bring in the current stack or
Material Mix inputs, or add the bundled Air reference. The workspace plots the
stored real and imaginary relative permittivity and permeability on each
file's native frequency grid. It also provides a compact range/coverage table
and a lazy raw-value table that remains responsive with large files. A
same-frequency view compares every material in one row-oriented table;
between stored samples it uses component-wise linear interpolation and marks
out-of-range files instead of extrapolating.

Explorer sources are session-only: adding, removing, or reloading them does not
dirty a FREDDY project and cannot emit a GHOST attachment. Changed or missing
source files are marked; **Reload selected** rereads them explicitly and keeps
the last valid cached data if a reload fails. The two loss tangents shown in
the tables are clearly labeled derived values and use `-imaginary/real`; no
other material properties are inferred. Density and conductivity are not in
the FREDDY material schema and therefore are not guessed by the explorer.
Curves above 5,000 stored rows use display-only extrema-preserving decimation;
the complete values remain available in the raw table.

## Portable project files

FREDDY JSON projects store layer materials, Material Mix files, and output
locations relative to the project JSON when they are in its directory tree or
one neighboring directory. Moving that folder structure to another machine
therefore keeps those links intact. More distant or cross-volume absolute paths
remain absolute, are listed in the JSON's `path_portability` metadata, and
produce a warning when loaded because the external file must be copied or
reselected separately. Project and nominal solver-facing CSV writes are
same-directory atomic, so a failed write does not truncate an existing file.

## Material CSV format

Material inputs and mixed-material exports use exactly five comma-separated
columns with a required header:

```csv
frequency_hz,eps_real,eps_imag,mu_real,mu_imag
1000000000,3.2,-0.15,1.0,0.0
```

Use a `.csv` extension. Both tools accept UTF-8 with or without a BOM, blank
lines, and full-line `#` comments. Header names and order must match the example;
surrounding cell whitespace is ignored. Space/tab-separated and headerless
files are rejected. See the [shared file format](../GHOST/MATERIAL_CSV_FORMAT.md).

Frequency is in Hz. FREDDY and GHOST use the `e^(+j omega t)` convention, so a
passive lossy material has negative imaginary permittivity and permeability.
Positive imaginary values are rejected as active/gain media. Frequencies must
be positive and unique; interpolation is linear in the real and imaginary
property components and extrapolation is not performed.

## Impedance CSV format

Nominal impedance exports and GHOST IBC inputs use the same required header,
comma separator, Hz frequency and impedance in ohms:

```csv
frequency_hz,resistance_ohm,reactance_ohm
1000000000,120,15
```

Uncertainty bounds are written to a separate `_uncertainty.csv` analysis file
so the nominal file remains directly readable by GHOST. Phase uncertainty
bounds are unwrapped about the nominal phase and can therefore lie outside
`[-180, 180]`; this avoids false 360-degree spans at the phase branch cut.

## Per-layer sensitivity and modeled yield

**Sensitivity & Yield** evaluates the current PEC-backed stack. To study an
inverse candidate, first **Apply Selected** in Inverse Design. Define the
frequency/angle grid, choose TE, TM, or Both, and enter a reflection limit.
The inverse-copy button transfers the inverse Setup band, angles, polarization
and requirement; it does not apply a candidate or copy completed results.

Each layer has separate bounds for thickness, signed ε′, ε″, μ′, μ″, or sheet
resistance. Zero disables a parameter. Bounds can be percentages of the
nominal component's magnitude or absolute values (inches, Ω/sq, or relative
properties). A trial uses the same normalized deviation across the full
material curve. Directional layers use the selected principal-axis properties
and retain the existing restrictions on oblique incidence.

Start with **Sensitivity only**. FREDDY varies one parameter at a time over
an odd, evenly spaced grid including nominal and both tolerance endpoints.
The **Sensitivity ranking** orders parameters by the largest loss of
whole-region margin. **Parameter tolerance sweep** plots that margin against
signed deviation. The table reports the first outward pass/miss bracket as
a fraction of the entered bound. Refine these sweeps before treating a narrow
feature as resolved; individual bounds are not joint tolerance guarantees.

Choose **Sensitivity + statistical trials** to simulate all inputs together:

- **Uniform:** values within the entered symmetric bounds.
- **Truncated normal (±3σ):** underlying standard deviation is bound/3;
  samples are truncated at the entered hard bounds.
- **Shared group:** matching names share a Gaussian manufacturing factor.
  The latent correlation of two inputs is the product of their loadings.
  Loadings +1/+1 move together, +1/−1 move oppositely, and a blank group is
  independent. Pearson correlations after bounded distribution transforms
  can differ from those latent correlations. Groups supply a common-factor
  model, not an arbitrary measured covariance matrix.

Statistical trials use a seeded scrambled Sobol sequence with a power-of-two
count (16–65,536), streamed in small batches without skipping or thinning.
Materials are interpolated once; each trial retains its margin while failure
counts accumulate by frequency, angle and polarization. No trial-by-grid
response cube is retained. Setup reports workload and an approximate analysis
array allowance, excluding loaded files, Python/Qt, plotting and export overhead.

**Margin distribution** shows each simulated stack's whole-region margin.
Margin ≥0 passes every sampled frequency, angle and selected polarization.
**Failure map** instead shows the percentage of trials failing at each point.
**Yield convergence** tracks the modeled whole-region pass fraction as the
sample count grows. This is conditional on the supplied distributions,
correlations and sampled operating points; it is not measured production yield
or a binomial confidence interval. Repeat seeds and refine the operating grid
to assess stability.

Bounds admitting gain, nonpositive thickness/resistance, or singular ε/μ are
rejected before sampling. Percentage variation of a zero component is also
rejected as ineffective. Symmetric absolute variation about zero imaginary
loss would admit gain; use a justified nominal material and passive bounds.

Inputs persist in projects and follow their layer through edits, reordering,
and inverse-candidate application. **Export study JSON** atomically saves
captured layer inputs, grid, requirement, sensitivities, trial margins, failure
counts, seed, sampling model, versions and material/implementation fingerprints.
Editing Setup does not relabel completed results. Stop or an error preserves
the previous successful result; loading a project clears results, as in other
FREDDY workflows. Figure export is available through the plot toolbar.

## Thickness-batch IBC export

Use **IBC Batch** to write one nominal solver-compatible IBC CSV for each
requested thickness of one material layer. Choose the layer, thickness
start/stop/step, and `in` or `mm`; the default 0.015-to-0.030 inch sweep
uses a 0.001 inch step and writes `ibc_0p015in.csv` through `ibc_0p03in.csv`.
Saved projects retain inches or millimeters. The Impedance frequency sweep is shared
with this mode. Every batch output is broadside and PEC-backed, and all other
layers, material tables, and stack ordering remain unchanged.

The preflight line shows the exact file count and endpoint names before the
run. Existing destinations require one confirmation for the complete set.
FREDDY computes and stages the complete set before publishing it, and restores
prior files if publication fails, so a partial batch is not left behind. A
multi-file batch is deliberately not auto-selected for GHOST; attach the CSV
for the desired thickness explicitly.

IBC Batch now opens **Results** after export. Compare reflection curves,
frequency/thickness maps, passing bandwidth, coverage, resistance/reactance,
and the sampled frequency of minimum reflection. The optional table links each
thickness to its output file. **Use selected IBC for GHOST** verifies the chosen
file against the exported result before enabling the existing GHOST handoff.
Results are published only for a completed batch; changed output files cannot
silently replace the data shown in its plots.

## Analysis results workspaces

**Impedance, IBC Batch, Thickness, and Off Angle** have separate Setup/Results
tabs, large plots, optional comparison tables, and run-context image exports.
Each mode retains its own last successful run. Editing setup does not relabel
the cached results; loading a project clears the session's result caches.

Thickness and Off Angle add reflection threshold contours, multiple frequency
overlays, nominal/worst-case passing bandwidth and coverage, tolerance envelopes,
and selected-frequency slices. Thickness also tracks the sampled null location.
A user-selected comparison band reports passing sampled thickness/angle ranges.
Bandwidth interpolates frequency samples without extrapolation, and grouped
passing samples do not guarantee untested intermediate conditions.

Hovering a sweep, TE/TM, coating-error, inverse angle, or sensitivity failure
map shows `(x, y, z)` in the plot toolbar, where z is the sampled value of the
cell under the cursor. Clicking a sweep map snaps **Selected** and **Slice GHz** to
the nearest computed samples, marks them with dashed crosshairs, and the toolbar
keeps reporting that `Selected (x, y, z)` point beside the hover readout.

Maps have a **Color scale** row that is automatic by default. Clearing **Auto**
fixes the displayed range. Enter round **Min**/**Max** values: later runs keep
the scale, so maps of two stacks match in a presentation. Each metric and its
tolerance span keep separate limits, so a dB scale is never applied to phase.
Fixed scales are saved with the project; a project saved without one keeps the
current session's scales. Colorbar arrows mark values clipped to fixed limits.
The inverse angle map has the same row. The Material Mix performance map uses
the **Auto color scale**, **Min** and **Max** fields above it; press Enter in
Min or Max to apply typed limits.

Off Angle can compute **TE and TM comparison** with a shared map scale. This
adds a second solve; the existing CSV continues to contain the selected primary
polarization. The comparison choice is stored in the project. For a directional
stack at oblique incidence, a valid TE run remains available when the model
cannot support the optional TM comparison.

Impedance displays resistance/reactance, reflection, tolerance bounds, and
nominal reflected/absorbed/transmitted power for its selected backing. The
GHOST coating check supplies TE/TM approximation-error charts and maps, with
the original report under Run details. It remains a planar scalar-IBC check,
not finite-body RCS certification.

See [Workflow shortcuts](../../WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for view definitions and the
file-selection workflow. Frequency overlays above 5,000 points retain extrema
while reducing display points only; exported values and band metrics are intact.

## Inverse design: analyze all combinations

**Fixed / variable layers…** defines fixed values or finite minimum/maximum/step
ranges. **Analyze all combinations** evaluates their complete Cartesian product
in a stable order. The setup displays the exact combination count, per-layer
value count and sampled limits, and frequency/angle/tolerance workload. Values
start at Minimum and advance by Step without exceeding Maximum; an off-step
Maximum is excluded. A varying range needs an explicit step.

There is no seed, sample budget, short search, or local refinement in Inverse
Design. Legacy project settings for those controls are ignored. **Keep best for
comparison** limits displayed candidates only, not evaluations. **Stop and keep
best** retains complete scores and marks an interrupted analysis incomplete.
**Resume remaining** finishes the same grid without rescoring completed designs,
or finishes interrupted plots. It is disabled once the run is complete. Inputs
and material contents must still match. For recovery after closing the
application, choose an optional **Recovery file** before starting. Completed
scores are saved about every 30 seconds at combination boundaries and when
scoring stops or completes. **Choose / save...** can also save an idle search.
Reopen the matching saved project, choose **Load checkpoint...**, then
**Resume remaining**. Clearing the recovery field disables disk saves.
Starting a fresh analysis with an existing recovery path selects a new
`-fresh-...fsearch` file automatically and leaves the existing file intact.
The Recovery file field shows the new destination. A loaded checkpoint can be
copied with **Choose / save...** before Resume rebuilds its plots.
Recovery archives contain scores and identity checks, not a project or material
copies; changed code, changed inputs, and corrupted scores are rejected. Plots
are rebuilt after loading without rescoring completed combinations. Recovery
files are limited to 512 MiB of scores; larger grids can still run with the
optional recovery field cleared.
Saved candidates receive separate project and output destinations. See the
[workflow guide](../../WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for examples. Material Mix retains its
separate recipe-search behavior.

Inverse Design now separates **Setup** and **Results**. Results opens after a
run and provides a full-width plot with three views: reflection overlays,
null depth versus passing bandwidth, and analysis history. The
candidate table can be shown for sorting and choosing overlays, or hidden for
more plot height. The selected candidate can be applied or saved from Results;
sorting does not change its identity. The plot toolbar exports the current view.

An adjustable reflection target (initially −10 dB) supports comparison of deep
narrow nulls against broader responses. The default curve is the pointwise
worst analyzed angle/tolerance case; analyzed-point percentiles remain available.
Band coverage and the widest contiguous passing interval are estimated by
linear interpolation in dB on the sampled sweep, without extrapolation.
Discrete targets report point coverage only, with no inferred bandwidth.
These are display metrics for retained candidates; the search continues to
rank its captured objective. Increase **Keep best** to review more
alternatives and use a finer frequency sweep to verify narrow features.

Analysis history shows every completed combination and the running best score,
including work preserved by Resume. A complete run finds the best selected
objective on the specified finite grid, not between grid values or under
untested conditions. A partial run is explicitly incomplete.

For a requirement over the full requested region, choose **Whole-band PEC
reflection requirement (worst point)** under Score and enter **Reflection limit
(dB)**. The objective minimizes `max(reflection_dB) − target_dB` across every
requested frequency, incidence angle, and nominal/tolerance case. Lower is
better; **Gap ≤ 0 passes**, and **Req. margin = −Gap**. A flat −11 dB design
therefore beats a −40/−1 dB narrow-null design against a −10 dB limit, even though
the narrow-null design has a better mean. The original mean objectives remain
available and keep their default behavior.

The captured search requirement appears in Results. Its gap and margin remain
fixed when the display target or percentile changes. Discrete targets apply the
limit at each requested point, without claiming an intervening band. Refine the
frequency/angle grid to verify between samples. Search recovery and candidate
application/save validate the objective, active limit, and constant properties;
changed inputs require a fresh search. Recovery files from older solver code
are rejected by the existing implementation fingerprint check; saved projects
remain loadable.

The selected candidate also has an angle/frequency map and a tolerance envelope
at a selected angle. The run retains explicit angle/tolerance labels for these
views; later setup changes cannot change their interpretation.

Combinations are generated by index without allocating all proposals. Five
scores per evaluated design are retained in a compact numeric array; full
response curves are computed only for the retained candidates. Material and
wave-term preparation is reused across the grid. Equal scores retain stable
grid order, making identical runs reproducible without a random seed.

## Numerical scope

- Incidence angle is measured from the surface normal and must satisfy
  `0 <= angle < 90 degrees`.
- Use TE/TM labels. HH=TE and VV=TM are retained only as legacy aliases for a
  vertical plane of incidence.
- Directional materials are supported only on their measured 0- or 90-degree
  principal axes. Arbitrary tensor rotation and cross-polarization require a
  full anisotropic field solver.
- Air-backed impedance is a planar analysis result, not generally a valid
  one-sided boundary condition for a closed transmitting body.
- Effective-medium rules are morphology-dependent approximations. The GUI
  reports their assumptions and should not be treated as a substitute for
  measured mixture properties.

## Material Mix workflows

The Material Mix tab supports three related jobs:

- Predict effective frequency-dependent ε and μ from a known volume recipe.
- Search bounded volume fractions for a target ε/μ curve or constant.
- Search bounded volume fractions and a specified layer thickness for a
  reflection, absorption, or transmission requirement across a frequency and
  incidence-angle grid.

Recipe samples are evaluated as they are generated; at most 100 candidates are
retained for comparison. Fixed bounds defining one recipe evaluate it once.
The setup shows the sample budget plus up to 300 additional refinement
evaluations per retained candidate. **Stop search** cancels sampling, refinement,
or result preparation without publishing an incomplete result. Changing inputs
while a search runs invalidates its eventual result.

**Export selected CSV** and **Add selected as layer** use the properties,
frequency grid, and thickness captured in the displayed result. They do not
recalculate from material files that may have changed on disk. Recalculate
explicitly to analyze updated material data. Project loading rejects malformed
recipe entries before changing the open study.

Performance targets can use PEC or air backing and TE or TM polarization. A
candidate's requirement gap is evaluated at every requested frequency/angle
point: for an upper limit the gap is `max(value) - target`, and for a lower
limit it is `target - min(value)`. A gap at or below zero passes. When material
or thickness uncertainty is enabled, the results separately report the worst
uncertainty-corner gap; this is the pass/fail value even if average-corner
scoring was selected for ranking.

The predicted or optimized effective properties still depend on the selected
mixing law and its morphology assumptions. Performance optimization does not
remove that limitation; validate a promising recipe with measured mixture
data before treating the result as a manufactured-material specification.

### Public-data validation pack

`materials/validation/nist_bam_pdms` contains unmodified, checksum-verified
NIST broadband BaM/PDMS source tables, deterministic conversion to FREDDY's Hz
and negative-loss-imaginary convention, and solver-level forward/inverse
Maxwell-Garnett regressions. Rebuild and validate it from the repository root:

```text
py -3 tools/FREDDY/tools/convert_nist_bam_pdms.py
py -3 tools/FREDDY/tools/validate_material_mix.py
```

The converted files can also be selected directly in the Material Mix tab as
normal FREDDY material inputs or targets. See
`materials/validation/nist_bam_pdms/README.md` for provenance, exclusions, and
the numerical acceptance limits.

## Tests

From the `tools/FREDDY` directory:

```text
py -3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The regression suite covers CSV sign/units, reference slab and sheet cases,
TE/TM power conservation, causal negative-index branches, layer ordering,
scalar/vector equivalence, stable thick-loss transmission, phase wrapping,
effective-medium formulas, deterministic public-data conversion, and measured
forward/inverse material-mix validation.
