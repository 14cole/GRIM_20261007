Metadata is advisory by default. Imported complex fields need no solver
certificate or feature-library manifest. The optional ``production`` and
``external`` profiles enable strict metadata auditing. An external monostatic
GRIM needs its matching indexed ASCII ``.facet``/STL platform surface when
placing features. Point and
line datasets use the single canonical OPN-FRD (featured-clean) differential
response.

The executable settings wrapper delegates to :mod:`feature_workflow`, which
is the Qt-free API for programmatic and GUI callers.
