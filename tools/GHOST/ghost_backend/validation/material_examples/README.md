# Loadable material examples

These inputs accompany the [geometry cheat sheet](../../../GEOMETRY_INPUT_CHEATSHEET.md).
They cover TYPE 1-5, including free impedance sheets, the new thin dielectric
layer, PEC, opaque IBC, bulk dielectric and magnetic material, explicit coatings,
two-material regions, spatial tapers and CSV tables.

1. Load one `.geo` in GHOST Geometry.
2. Set geometry units to **meters** and select the **2D** solver.
3. Start at **1 GHz**, with a few angles such as 12, 48 and 86 degrees.
4. For production results, request mesh convergence and inspect the accuracy
   report. The thin-layer approximation also needs a physical applicability check.

Each file is a complete geometry. Keep `surface_impedance.csv` and
`radome_material.csv` beside the geometry when copying CSV examples. Both use
required headers and comma-separated values with frequency in Hz. All tables
span 800000000-1200000000 Hz (0.8-1.2 GHz).

Most squares are 100 mm across. The explicit coating examples have an 80 mm
core; the two-dielectric example has a 50 mm core. All closed contours are
clockwise. The TYPE 5 core normal points into shell material 1; the core is
material 2. The thin strip is 100 mm long with thickness stored as 0.0005 meters.

For a FREDDY stack collapsed to a TYPE 2 boundary, use the separate
[PEC-backed coating workflow](../pec_backed_ibc/README.md). Its 30 mil examples
use **inches**, not the meters used here.

These are instructional fixtures with invented material values, not material
recommendations or certified scattering benchmarks. They are 2D cross sections;
BoR requires its own appropriate generating curve. Syntax, material loading,
round-trip serialization, and small two-polarization solves were checked on
September 5, 2026: the original 17-file set loaded and solved at 1 GHz for incidence and
observation angles 12, 48 and 86 degrees, yielding nine finite samples per
polarization. Production accuracy requires separate convergence.
