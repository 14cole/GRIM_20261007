"""
Explain a "solver source/native artifacts differ from the HPC run manifest" error.

That check hashes every top-level source and native artifact under ghost_backend/,
plus the driver being executed, and compares the result to what the run
recorded at submit time. When it fires, the useful question is *which file* --
almost always a tree that was only partly updated, or code edited after the
run was submitted.

Run this on the compute node (or wherever the worker failed), against the run
directory it was pointed at:

    python tests/diagnose_provenance.py <run_dir> [--driver <driver_configured.py>]

Runs submitted before per-file inventories existed can only be diagnosed by
comparison, not by name; this says so rather than guessing.
